# TimeManager Application Security Analysis Report

## Overview
This report provides a comprehensive security analysis of the TimeManager web application. The evaluation covers various aspects of web security, including susceptibility to common vulnerabilities and the robustness of implemented security measures.

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
- **Status**: Not Vulnerable
- **Details**: The application is protected against XSS attacks by using XSRF tokens, which help prevent unauthorized script injections.

## 2. SQL/NoSQL Injection Vulnerability
- **Status**: Not Vulnerable
- **Details**: The application uses Elixir ORM, which automatically filters requests before they reach the database, thereby mitigating the risk of SQL/NoSQL injections.

## 3. Accessible Configuration Files
- **Method Used**: Dirbuster Scan
- **Findings**: A scan was conducted using Dirbuster with the following details:
  - **Start Time**: Fri Nov 10 14:45:09 2023
  - **URL Base**: `http://timemanager.freeboxos.fr:8080/`
  - **Wordlist**: `/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt`
  - **End Time**: Fri Nov 10 14:47:26 2023
  - **Results**: The scan discovered an accessible directory (`/assets/`) and a favicon file, but no sensitive configuration files were exposed.

## 4. Password Hash Security
- **Method**: SHA256 and bcrypt
- **Details**: Passwords are initially hashed using SHA256 and subsequently processed with bcrypt, enhancing the security of stored password hashes.

## 5. Route Access Control
- **Status**: Secure
- **Details**: The application verifies the user's role before granting access to specific routes, ensuring that routes are not accessible by unauthorized users.

## 6. Endpoint Access Control
- **Status**: Secure
- **Details**: Endpoints are protected using Guardian JWT tokens and XSRF mechanisms, preventing unauthorized access.

## 7. Database Denial of Service (DoS) Risk
- **Status**: Not Vulnerable
- **Details**: The application has safeguards in place to prevent database filling, which could otherwise lead to a denial of service when rendering pages.

## 8. JWT Tokens Security
- **HTTP-Only**: Partial
- **Details**: XSRF tokens are HTTP-only, but JWT tokens are stored in local storage and are verified with each request. This could pose a risk if local storage is compromised.

## 9. Transmission of Passwords
- **Method**: SHA256 Hashing
- **Details**: Passwords are hashed using SHA256 before being transmitted, mitigating the risk of password interception in clear text.

## 10. HTTPS Availability
- **Status**: Not Available (HTTP Only)
- **Potential Risk**: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack
- **Details**: Since the application is only available over HTTP, it is susceptible to MitM attacks. Attackers could potentially intercept client-server communication using tools like Ettercap for connection hijacking and Wireshark for request analysis.

## Recommendations
- **Implement HTTPS**: To protect against MitM attacks and ensure secure data transmission.
- **Review JWT Token Storage**: Consider alternatives to storing JWT tokens in local storage to reduce the risk of token theft.

## Conclusion
The TimeManager application exhibits robust defenses against several common web vulnerabilities, including XSS and injection attacks. However, areas for improvement include adopting HTTPS and reevaluating the storage of JWT tokens. By addressing these concerns, the application can enhance its overall security posture.

# TimeManager Application Security Analysis Report - Addendum

## Overview
This addendum addresses additional considerations regarding the security posture of the TimeManager web application, specifically focusing on network-level security aspects and server configurations.

## Network-Level Security

### Nmap Scan Blockage
- **Observation**: It has been noted that the server is configured to block Nmap scans, which prevents external entities from easily identifying open ports and services running on the server.
- **Implications**: While this can be seen as a defensive measure against reconnaissance activities, it also makes it challenging for legitimate security assessments to evaluate the server's exposure to network-level threats.

### SSH Access via RSA Key
- **Details**: SSH access to the server is reportedly restricted to RSA key authentication.
- **Security Implication**:
  - **Positive**: This approach significantly enhances the security of SSH access, as it relies on cryptographic keys rather than potentially weak passwords. It mitigates the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.
  - **Recommendation**: Regularly review and rotate SSH keys, and ensure they are of adequate length (e.g., 2048 bits or more) to maintain strong security.

## Additional Recommendations
Given these observations, the following additional recommendations are proposed:

1. **Regular Network Scans and Audits**: While blocking Nmap scans can deter malicious actors, it's important for the organization to regularly conduct internal network scans and audits to identify and address any vulnerabilities.
2. **Firewall Configuration Review**: Ensure that the firewall is properly configured to allow only necessary traffic and that all unnecessary ports and services are blocked.
3. **Implement Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)**: To monitor network traffic for suspicious activities that could indicate a breach or an ongoing attack.
4. **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**: Implement robust logging of access attempts (both successful and unsuccessful) and regular monitoring of these logs for anomalies.
5. **Vulnerability Management Program**: Establish a program to regularly scan, identify, and remediate vulnerabilities across the network and server infrastructure.

## Conclusion
The TimeManager application's network and server configurations exhibit a proactive stance toward security, particularly with the blocking of port scans and the exclusive use of RSA key authentication for SSH. By implementing the additional recommendations, the application can further strengthen its security posture against potential network-level threats and server vulnerabilities.
